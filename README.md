# Forecasting-Demand-with-PySpark

In this project, I demonstrated my skills in data science, particularly within the context of e-commerce sales forecasting. I utilized PySpark to preprocess and analyze a large dataset of retail transactions. Employing machine learning techniques, I built a robust pipeline that included feature engineering, and trained a Random Forest model to forecast product quantities sold. Finally, I effectively communicated the resulting insights from the model, such as predicting sales volumes for specific weeks of the year, demonstrating proficiency in both technical implementation and practical application of data-driven solutions in business contexts.
